# Whisper GUI

### Accelerated Real-Time Speech Recognition 
Stacks:
1. OpenAIâ€™s Whisper model
2. Intel's OpenVINO toolkit
3. Qt for Python

This application supports both file-based transcription and real-time microphone recording with transcription capabilities. 

### Architecture Design 
The system is organized into four main components:
1. UI Layer (MyWidget): The graphical user interface implemented using PySide6 (Qt for Python). 
2. Recording Manager: Handles microphone recording with real-time processing. 
3. Model Manager: Manages model downloading, storage, and loading. 
4. Audio Processor: Processes audio data and performs transcription.
